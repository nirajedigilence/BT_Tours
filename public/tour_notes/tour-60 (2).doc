While the property is a historic sight in its own right, dating back to 1671 and sitting on the site of the town's first-ever hotel, this 4-star hotel is only a quick stroll away from some of Harrogate's must-see sights.</p><h4>Experience: Royal Crescent Bath: Private Guided Tour</h4><p></p><p>If you weren&#39;t swooning over the cast, you were swooning over the architecture, and you are sure to recognise this street as the recreation of Regency London from your popcorn escapism. One of Bath&#39;s most iconic landmarks, the Royal Crescent consists of 30 Grade 1-listed terrace houses and is lauded one of the greatest examples of Georgian architecture anywhere in the UK. In real-life, the first property on the street is a museum revealing what life was like for Bath&#39;s most talked about residents of the 1700s, both upstairs and downstairs.</p><h4>Experience: Walking Tour of Bath</h4><p></p><p>Whilst the sparky period piece is based in London, the famously pleasing city of Bath sets the backdrop for most of Bridgerton &ndash; Netflix&rsquo;s most viewed original series. Embrace your hunger for gossip with our charismatic guide, and wander through the cobbled streets as we chat about its history and residents, with all of the scandal and dirty secrets left in. Admire the Pulteney Bridge, Bath Abbey, the Roman Baths and Thermae Bath Spa. Of course, we&rsquo;ll pay a visit to the Queen Square, the Theatre Royal, and the Royal Crescent, it&rsquo;s unique sweeping arc immediately familiar. Do be sure to keep an eye out for Madame Delacroix&#39;s charming dress shop along the way.</p><h4>Experience: Badminton Estate & House</h4><p></p><p>It&#39;s no surprise Badminton House was chosen to play a part in Bridgerton as the saucy Duke of Hastings London home, as well as the parlour and grounds of Clyvedon Castle. By invitation only, we&#39;ll go behind the scenes on a tour of the house and gardens of the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort&#39;s family home, as our guide recounts stories of successive dukes who have each made their own enhancements.</p></body>
